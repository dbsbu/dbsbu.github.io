# Syllabus
**Download the [syllabus](Syllabus.pdf)** **(Farsi)** 
## **Topics Covered**
<!--- This is my first time teaching this course, so the list below may be subject to slight changes due to time constraints. --->
- Principles and Basic Concepts
- The Relational Data Model, Relational Algebra, and Relational Calculus
- Structured Query Language (SQL) 
- The Entity-Relationship Data Model
- Database Design Theory
- Introduction to PostgreSQL
- Introduction to NoSQL (comparing and contrasting MongoDB with relational systems)
- Python database integration (connecting Python programs to both SQL and NoSQL databases)


## **Structure of the course**
<!-- Meets twice weekly -->
- Meets Twice Weekly
  - **Saturday, Monday (17:00 - 18:30)**
- There will be several assignments throughout the course for students to practice the material covered.
- There will be a summative final project, in which students will integrate the tools and techniques they have learned into a cohesive whole. 

## **Homework Assignments**

Throughout the course, students will complete several homework assignments aimed at reinforcing the concepts covered in lectures and reading materials (See the [homework page](https://dbsbu.github.io//assignments/), which will be updated during the course). The due dates for these assignments will be posted on this website.

Please follow the instructions to turn in your homework:
- Homeworks must be submitted electronically as PDF files.
- Files should be named according to the following scheme:
   - HW<2-digits homework number>\_\<LastName>\_\<FirstName>.pdf.
   - For instance, my first homework would be called HW01_Vazan_Milad.pdf.
- Email your homework to **vazan.sbu@gmail.com**

## **Exams**

The course will include **two exams**. Both exams will assess the required readings and topics covered in class. The first exam will be an "in-class" midterm, while the second will be a final exam scheduled during the University's final examination period at the end of the semester.

**If you need to miss the midterm test due to illness or a family affliction, please contact me by email. A make-up exam for the midterm might be organized.**

## **Attendance and Participation**

**Attendance is required**, and exceeding four absences may result in a penalty of up to 2 points off your total grade. Active participation in both in-class activities and the online message board is highly encouraged.

## **Grading**
- Class attendance and participation: **2** points 
- Homeworks: **4** points
- Final project: **3** points 
- Midterm exam (1404/?/?): **4** points
- Final exam (1404/04/02 - 14:00-16:00): **7** points 


## **Seeking Assistance**

Here are the available help resources, organized by the urgency of your issue:

### **Messaging**
Our course will utilize a Telegram group (link to be provided in class) as the primary communication platform for announcements and discussions. This is an ideal space for asking questions that can be answered by anyone. It's best to use this resource for non-urgent inquiries.

### **Talk with the Instructor**
For any issues at all, please reach out to the instructor:

- Speak with me before class  
- Raise your hand or speak up during class


## **Collaboration Policy**

You are encouraged to discuss the content of this course with anyone you like; however, it is essential to **maintain academic integrity** in your work. All homework assignments, projects, and exams must be completed independently, meaning you are not permitted to copy any part of another student’s solution, collaborate with others on your assignments, or use solutions from unauthorized sources, including the Internet. **Therefore, the solution you submit for each assignment must be solely your own, reflecting your understanding and effort.**

## **Generative AI Usage Guidelines**

You are encouraged to use Generative AI tools like ChatGPT for general coding-related queries. **However, refrain from asking these tools to directly solve problems from the course problem sets.** Below are examples of acceptable questions:
1. How can I remove duplicates in a SQL query?
2. How do I handle database connection errors in Python?
3. What are the differences between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?
4. What libraries are available for connecting Python to PostgreSQL?

## **Textbooks/Materials**
**My lecture notes are sufficient for students to successfully pass the examination.**

There is no single textbook for this class. Instead, the material will be drawn from various texts and sources. For a general book that aligns with the course level, I recommend:
